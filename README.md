# OpenMMO Updater

## Background

The updater uses Java bytecode analysis to identify classes and properties of classes in an obfuscated Java application. It identifies classes using known patterns and signatures of the classes and attempts to find the obfuscated class and fields across multiple updates of the application and various obfuscation techniques.
